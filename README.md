The Detection of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images by using Convolutional Neural Network 
Pneumonia poses a serious threat to world health, with large morbidity and death rates, especially in susceptible groups including children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. In order to effectively manage pneumonia, a timely and correct diagnosis is essential. This enables the rapid implementation of suitable treatment options. 
A crucial component in confirming the presence of pneumonia has been the use of medical imaging, especially chest X-rays. Radiologists have historically been the experts in visual interpretation of these pictures, but the complexity of image processing and the growing need for healthcare services have prompted the investigation of automated techniques.Deep learning algorithms known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance in image identification tests, suggesting that they might be a viable option for improving the effectiveness and precision of pneumonia diagnosis in chest X-rays.
The system’s interpretability enhances the trust of healthcare professionals, aiding in clinical decision-making. This project contributes to the automation of pneumonia diagnosis, offering a reliable and efficient solution for radiologists and healthcare providers. we applied multiple data augmentation strategies to improve the CNN model’s classification.
